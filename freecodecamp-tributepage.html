        <h2 id="biography">A Recap of Hedy Lamarr's Life</h2>
        <ul id="life-summary">
          <li><b>1914</b> - Hedy Lamaar was born as Hedwig Eva Kiesler on November 9, 1914 in Vienna, Austria.</li>
          <li class="indent">From the age of 5, she learned complex ideas, such as the mechanism of her music box, printing press, and street cars from her father, who was a curious bank director. However, her interests were ignored, and her beauty was emphasized. Her pianist mother introduced her to performing arts, enrolling her in ballet and piano classes from a young age.</li>
          <li><b>1930</b> - She studied acting in Berlin and got her first small role at age 16.</li>
          <li><b>1932</b> - She started gaining recognition from her role in <i>Ecstasy</i>.</li>
          <li><b>1933</b> - She married Fritz Mandl, an arm dealer. However, they soon separated as she felt objectified in the relationship, which subsequently hindered her acting career.</li>
          <li><b>1937</b> - She fled to London with some weaponry knowledge she gained from her former husband's conversations with his friends and colleagues.</li>
          <li class="indent">While in London, she was discovered by Louis B. Mayer of the MGM Studios in Hollywood.</li>
          <li class="indent">She was soon introduced to businessman and pilot Howard Hughes. The two started dating, as Lamarr was intrigued by Hughes' desire for innovation.</li>
          <li class="indent">Hughes took Lamarr to his airplane factories and showed her how airplanes were made. He had a desire to create faster airplanes that would be sold to the US Military, which inspired Lamarr.</li>
          <li class="indent">Lamarr started studying fish and birds through books. Then, she sketched a plane wing design using ideas from the fastest fish's fins and the fastest bird's wings. Upon showing Hughes the designed, she was proclaimed a 'genius' by him.</li>
         <li class="indent">She continued to create innnovative products, such as a tablet that would dissolve in water to make a carbonated drink, and an upgraded spotlight.</li>
         <li><b>1940</b> - Lamarr met George Antheil, a composer/writer who shared the same innovative spirit. They mutually expressed concerns over the upcoming war and agreed to explore ideas to aid the combat, using her existing knowledge in weaponry.</li>
         <li class="indent">The two came up with the "frequency hopping" system among radio waves. The system would prevent interception of radio waves, allowing the torpedo to find its intended target.
          <li><b>1942</b> - Lamarr and Antheil's innovation was awarded a patent (Patent No. 2,292,387) in August of 1942. However, the navy decided not to implement the system, turning Lamarr to sell war bonds using her celebrity status in support of the war.</li>
          <li><b>1953</b> - Lamarr became a citizen of the United States. She continued to be a successsful actress until 1958.</li>
          <li><b>1997</b> - Lamarr and Antheil received a joint 'Pioneer Award' by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</li>
          <li class="indent">Following this award, Lamarr also received the 'Invention Conventions's Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award,' making her the first woman to do so.</li>
         <li><b>2000</b> - In her later years, Lamarr lived a reclusive life and passed away on January 19, 2000 just north of Orlando, Florida, at the age of 85. She was survived by three children. </li>
          <li><b>2014</b> - Lamarr received a posthumous induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the development of the frequency hopping technology.
            <li class="indent">Her and Antheil's invention continued to be the basis for other wireless communication, such as the GPS, Bluetooth, and eventually WiFi. Lamarr was, then, recognized as the "Mother of WiFi."
